# Compiling

1. Obtain Foundation from github.com/kangarko/Foundation
2. Create library/ folder in Boss/ and obtain binaries described in pom.xml. You have to obtain them yourself. Regarding Boss, you can just remove the very few references to it in the source code and remove the dependency from pom.xml.
3. Compile Foundation and Boss using Maven with the "clean install" goal.

Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy:

<i>Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.</i>
